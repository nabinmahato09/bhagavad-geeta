The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to simply as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It consists of a conversation between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. This discourse takes place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra just before a great war, where Arjuna is filled with doubt and moral dilemma about fighting in the war. The Gita addresses the concepts of duty, righteousness, and the nature of reality, emphasizing the importance of doing one's duty and adhering to one's path with devotion and without attachment to the results. It is considered one of the most important spiritual classics and has influenced various philosophies and practices around the world.🙏🙏🙏
